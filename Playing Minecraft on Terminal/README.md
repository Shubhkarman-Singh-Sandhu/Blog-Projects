# Playing Minecraft on the Terminal

This folder contains two files

- Cleaner

  This is the cleaner version of the code with synatic sugar, explained on my [blog](https://originalcodingcult.blogspot.com/2021/03/playing-minecraft-in-terminal.html "Original Coding Cult")
- Optimized

  This is a bit more optimized (eventhough that is not the correct), by removing some redundant lines of code and will run teeny-bit faster.

  If you can make this run much more faster then please tell me your suggestions!
